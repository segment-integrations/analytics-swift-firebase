# Analytics-Swift Firebase

Add Firebase device mode support to your applications via this plugin for [Analytics-Swift](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-swift)

## Adding the dependency

***Note:** the Firebase library itself will be installed as an additional dependency.*

### via Xcode
In the Xcode `File` menu, click `Add Packages`.  You'll see a dialog where you can search for Swift packages.  In the search field, enter the URL to this repo.

https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics-swift-firebase

You'll then have the option to pin to a version, or specific branch, as well as which project in your workspace to add it to.  Once you've made your selections, click the `Add Package` button.  

### via Package.swift

Open your Package.swift file and add the following do your the `dependencies` section:

```
.package(
            name: "Segment",
            url: "https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics-swift-firebase.git",
            from: "1.1.3"
        ),
```


*Note the Firebase library itself will be installed as an additional dependency.*


## Using the Plugin in your App

Open the file where you setup and configure the Analytics-Swift library.  Add this plugin to the list of imports.

```
import Segment
import SegmentFirebase // <-- Add this line
```

Just under your Analytics-Swift library setup, call `analytics.add(plugin: ...)` to add an instance of the plugin to the Analytics timeline.

```
let analytics = Analytics(configuration: Configuration(writeKey: "<YOUR WRITE KEY>")
                    .flushAt(3)
                    .trackApplicationLifecycleEvents(true))
analytics.add(plugin: FirebaseDestination())
```

Your events will now begin to flow to Firebase in device mode.
